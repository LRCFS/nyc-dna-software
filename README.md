# Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science Contribution

The Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science ([LRCFS](http://www.dundee.ac.uk/leverhulme)) based at the University of Dundee is a research centre trying to push the boundaries of Forensic Science. We have made minor changes to the FST framework and in-built hardcoded variables purely for the purposes of making a portable and working version. **No changes** have been made to the underlying algorithms or functionality of the tool.

## Disclaimer

This is purely a research exercise and no implicit or explicit guarantee is made regarding the accuracy of the results generated by this implementation of FST.

## Changelog

  * Styling fixes to correct display errors in the browser
  * added Microsoft report viewer DLLs for ease of build

# Forensic Statistical Tool Source Code

ProPublica obtained the source code for New York City's Forensic Statistical Tool (FST), developed by employees of the city's medical examiner's office to help analyze complex DNA evidence from crime scenes.

The software source code contained within this repository is [Copyright © City of New York](https://github.com/propublica/nyc-dna-software/blob/master/FST.Web/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs#L13) and was [unsealed by a federal judge](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4113796-10-16-17-Judge-Order-Unsealing-Records.html) after a [motion by ProPublica](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4062187-US-v-Johnson-ProPublica-Memorandum-of-Law.html).

**For more info, and for links to newly unredacted expert affidavits analyzing this program, please read [our story about this source code release](https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-judge-unseals-new-york-crime-labs-software-for-analyzing-dna-evidence).**
